# statofic-club 
The idea behind Statofic was to create an online platform for Statisticians, data scientist, mathematicians & coders to collaborate on the research work (publications, research projects, tools, articles related to the field) they are doing and to be updated about the fields in different languages. I got this motivation through one of my Japanese friend who faced an immense problem with the English language, so I thought to create an online open source web platform which could later be used as a repository.

The following contributions are planned:
1. Adding a login page
2. Adding more languages and adding individual folders for contribution with a user login
3. Implement elastic search
