The inspiration behind this web portal was to  create an online repository for students and professionals in the field of statistics, econometicians, finance professionals. This was a small step aiming towards collaboration of industry and academia within the field of Statistics and Economics and be updated with the projects and publications coming in and that too for free :)

The following contributions are planned:
1. Adding a login page
2. Adding more languages and adding individual folders for contribution with a user login
3. Implement search
